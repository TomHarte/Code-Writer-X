Code Writer X
=============

A tool to view Cliff Harris' CodeWriter documents under OS X.

![The Main Window](Images/MainWindow.png)

This short program includes code (i) to parse the resource forks used under older version of the Mac OS (via the entirely up-to-date com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute); and (ii) hence to parse and display those files created by Cliff Harris for his CodeWriter System.

The original PowerPC/68000 Classic OS document reader and Cliff's documents are available at http://home.earthlink.net/~cliff_harris/freeware/CodeWriter/index.html and are distributed as freeware. This repository includes an OS X-based reader and all available document sets.

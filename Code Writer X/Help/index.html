	</head>
	<body>
<p>Code Writer X is a viewer for Cliff Harris' CodeWriter documents. Those documents originated on the Classic OS and were encoded such that all snippets relevant to each code area were contained within the resource fork of one file. This has made them difficult to view on modern computers.</p>

<p>This program allows Cliff's work to be searched and viewed on a modern OS X computer. The original files are freeware and this program is freeware. Cliff's files have been modified only to relocate the contents of the resource fork to the data fork.</p>
